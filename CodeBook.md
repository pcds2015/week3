# Codebook for programming assignment in week 3 of the Cleaning Data Coursera course

The cleaned data contains the following data variables:

 * "subject" is the ID of the subject in the experiment
 * "activity" is the activity label that was assigned in the experiment
 * "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" averages over mean acceleration in the X direction grouped by subject and activity
 * "tBodyAcc-std()-X" averages over the standard deviation of acceleration in the X direction grouped by subject and activity

(There is only one acceleration variable to demonstrate that data has been cleaned. The remaining variables have been ignored.)
